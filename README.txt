Couple of notes on Assignment 1

1. The repository was forked from Dr. Peng's github therefore it contained older files. These files are in the archive folder.

2. I created a seperate folder, namely 'Figures', in the master branch. This folder contains all the figures that I have created.

3. All the relevant items (Data, R script, Markdown file and HTML file) are visible in the main branch.
